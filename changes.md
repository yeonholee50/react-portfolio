July 25 @ 8:00 PM is final start - life is too short mentality












we need to change A-man project with this updated info:






Balance all aspects, not just lob sided
# physical: to workout at 10:00 AM - avoid rush hour traffic + sunburn: - get gym membership at either lifetime or crunch - whichever has best equipment for price - less than $100 per month optimally but also close location optimized. evening - 1 hour walk
grind each part of body - at least 1 hour each day in gym - during rest day, it's skip day
sunday: leg day
monday: back day
tuesday: arm day
wednesday: rest day
thursday: shoulder day
friday: jog at fowler
saturday: chest day
 - cut until 75 kg - by september 30
 - october - bulk until 80kg - greek yogurt + fruit
 - still do walk 
 november + december 31 - until then shread until 70 kg

 woo doo hwan body and vibe of choi woo shik

 dont do sudden weightloss by running 2-3 4 hours saying this is restrant. good weightloss and clear skin is achieved through gradual progress and constant grind - remember that.

Avoid anything sugar or heavy oil substanced. Gear towards physical performance and organic food + food cooked by mother - any food that is not planned or does not gear towards goal is what is holding you back. For example, if korean fried chicken, eat chicken breast and avoid the fried skin pieces

strive for that glass skin - 1 face mask per week in evening before sleep - on friday

shower thoroughly and with ice cold water after workout and lukewarm water after 1 hour walk everyday. 

# career wise:
in georgia:
work hard: only focus on 3 things. Everyday should either be geared towards:
Creating the AmpyFin system - at least 6 hours per day
Create HPE System - at least 2 hours per day
Software Engineer job application to big firms / legit start ups and not recruitment - at least 8 per day - at least 4 hours per day
Leetcode Practice + Job Prep - 1 hour per day
Planning / Review - 1 hour per day. No Netflix or youtube - time is short - always be on the grind - you can relax when in Korea but not in the US

in nyc, chicago, boston, or SF - if job acquired:
weekend should be dedicated towards AmpyFin - at least 8 hours per day
2 hours per day on HPE system

the only times you have breaks are when you already completed the tasks that were planned and if it's a day tottenham play in prem or tottenham play in ucl or a ucl match that is top quality. That's it.


# social:
Don't talk much and think before acting. Do all chores that are being done by mother:
washing dishes + doing laundry + folding laundry + lawn mowing 
rebrand insta - keep private and update - on december 31, and follow ppl that you used to follow - make it look clean and legit - start following the closest ppl - not family initially


# mental:
be friendly with ppl. But don't be a pushover.
think before acting speaking etc. If you question whether to speak or not, just don't.
Also never talk about yourself unless asked and don't carry on. Just answer what is asked but if it's a conversation, then you can just talk but don't make the topic that's not about you as you. That's a huge turn off and something you need to work
Be able to be on grind mode - turned on and grind mode turned off



# financial obligations:
on blackfriday november:
thinkpad for mother - november 2025
brother thinkpad - used google best buy credit to buy thinkpad and during black friday recorded as used and then i got $1000 credit back since google gave $2000 per laptop credit with total being $30000 - 3 of the employees said they didn't need to use it which is why i bought - pick up from best buy and give


2 macbook airs for hyewon and hyeyoon - keep until you go to korea in may and give to them - try to buy duing black friday but also reminded to just buy before going to korea in May 2026 - communicate with cousin to see if free before going but try to go because of pohang wedding - find out when it is and go at least 3 days before the wedding - plan to stay for around a month to a month and a half if remote is possible. otherwise, go for only two weeks in days when hyeyoon is free.

also monthly payment towards mother and father for $500 per month - even after moving out. this is the case if you make more than $6000 per month net income. Otherwise, $300. IF you make about $8000 net monthly, then give $750 per month. If you make $10000 net monthy or more, then give $1000 per month.

a dji drone - order through best buy during black friday sale - controller with phone attached as screen + good range - for dad to play around with after he retires - research before buying - $1000 limit - it's the last present

Be financially responsible. Be frugal when you need to be but don't cheap out. Once you acquired fulltime, you can spend $200 each month on personal spending maximum. 50% of what is left after rent + other planned spending goes into fidelity from monthly net income

For fidelity investmentm buy ETFs and big cap stocks + stocks with potential in AI, quantum computing:
Allocate: 40% towards tech + SPY ETFs, 40% towards big cap stocks, and 10% towards ARK investment ETFs +10% towards small cap stocks with potential to disrupt - when you have career

If VIX index goes over 30, then allocate 20% of savings into fidelity. 
If VIX index goes over 40, then allocate 30% of savings into fidelity
If VIX index goes over 50, then allocate 40% of savigns into fidelity - 
This remainds same even after 50% of what is left after rent + other planned spending goes into fidelity in specified percentage from monthly net income.

please keep in mind we need to have at least $5000 in bank account for this investment to keep going. If bank account has less than $5000, sieze all investing. 

spending geared towards self improvment while frugal should not be compromized towards performance. monthly rent should be at most 25% of monthly income optimally.
